# gamma-filter-python
This is an easy-to-use gamma filter implementation (http://www.cnel.ufl.edu/courses/EEL6502/principe_gamma_1993.pdf)

The codes are written with ipython notebook.

It requires a GPU and pytorch to run. The code can be very easily changed to CPU-only settings.

You can also access to the code on Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oZqlz9TRRHufX-UPs7zynbVNVvyn4YhB?usp=sharing).
